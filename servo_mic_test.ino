// servo_mic_test.ino
// ESP32-S3 Supermini + INMP441 (I2S mic) + 9g (or bigger) hobby servo.
//
// Runs a scheduled sequence of servo moves while continuously streaming
// mic audio out over USB serial, so movement noise is captured with no
// gaps. Prints a JSON test plan first (so the PC side knows what happened
// when), then a delimiter line, then raw 16-bit PCM forever.
//
// UNTESTED — written without hardware to compile/flash against. Likely
// things to check on first flash:
//   - Arduino-ESP32 core version: this uses the legacy `driver/i2s.h` API.
//     Core v3.x may want `driver/i2s_std.h` instead — if i2s_driver_install
//     fails to compile, that's why.
//   - ESP32Servo needs a core with LEDC available on your chosen pin.
//   - Baud 921600 over native USB CDC should be plenty for 16kHz*16bit
//     (32 KB/s), but confirm your serial monitor / pyserial can hold it.
//
// Wiring (avoid ESP32-S3 strapping pins 0/3/45/46):
//   INMP441   VDD->3V3  GND->GND  L/R->GND (left ch)  WS->GPIO12  SCK->GPIO11  SD->GPIO13
//   Servo     signal->GPIO8  power from the board's 5V pin (fine for a 9g SG92R), and
//             share ground with the ESP32.
